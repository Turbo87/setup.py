![setup.py cheatsheet screenshot](screenshot.png)

This repository holds the code for the interactive setup.py cheatsheet. It was
inspired by the [package.json cheatsheet](http://package.json.nodejitsu.com/)
from the [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) community and provides the same service
for the `setup.py` file which is common for most python projects.
